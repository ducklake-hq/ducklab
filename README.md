## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

DuckLab provides local SQL notebook experience for adhoc data analysis. It uses DuckDB to process your data within browser and VS Code. No data leaves your machine.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to use `pnpm`,

```
# Install pnpm (if you don't have it installed already)

pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm run dev
```

Or if you are using `npm`
```
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
